# The-Quora-Question-Pair-Similarity

In a question similarity project, the goal is to develop a system that can compare two questions and determine their similarity. This can be a useful feature for question-answering platforms, forums, and other online communities, as it can help identify duplicate or near-duplicate questions and redirect users to existing answers.

Here are some of the high-level steps that are typically involved in a question similarity project:

Data collection: Collect a large dataset of question-answer pairs, which will be used to train and test the question similarity model.

Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to remove any irrelevant information, such as special characters, stopwords, and numbers. This step is important as it helps in creating a standard format of the question, making it easier to compare.

Feature extraction: Extract features from the questions that will be used to compare their similarity. This can include word embeddings, bag-of-words representations, and other features.

Model training: Train a model using the extracted features and the question-answer pairs. This can include using techniques such as cosine similarity,word2vec 

 Levenshtein distance, Word Mover's Distance, BERT based Similarity .

Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Deployment: Deploy the trained model in a production environment where it can be used to identify duplicate or near-duplicate questions in real-time.
